Description: Contains regional Floristic Quality Assessment databases that
    have been approved or approved with reservations by the U.S. Army
    Corps of Engineers (USACE). Paired with the 'fqacalc' R package, these
    data sets allow for Floristic Quality Assessment metrics to be
    calculated. For information on FQA see Spyreas (2019)
    <doi:10.1002/ecs2.2825>. Both packages were developed for the USACE by
    the U.S.  Army Engineer Research and Development Center's
    Environmental Laboratory.
